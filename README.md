This is a simplified version of a quiz game that allows players to test their knowledge in various categories and difficulty levels. The application provides an interactive and engaging quiz experience, where players can select a category and difficulty level before starting the game.

**Features**

- Game Setup: Players can start a new game by selecting a category and difficulty level. The available categories include History, Science, Gaming, and more. The difficulty levels range from Easy, Medium, to Hard.

- Question Display: Once the game starts, questions are displayed one at a time with multiple-choice answers. Players need to select their answer within 30 seconds.

- Game Logic: The player selects an answer for each question, and the application provides instant feedback, indicating whether the answer is correct or incorrect. The score is kept track of throughout the game. If the player fails to answer within the given time, a notification reminds them to hurry up, and a default answer is automatically selected if no response is given.

- Results: After the last question, the player's score is displayed along with a summary of correct and wrong answers. Players have the option to play again and improve their score.

- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. It provides a seamless user experience across different screen sizes and orientations.
